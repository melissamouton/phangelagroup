											<h3>Early History</h3>
											<p>Born in Queenstown in the Eastern Cape, Greg spent his early years moving around South Africa as his father, a bank manager transferred to various locations. <br>

												<br>“Moving around and having to change schools a lot allowed me to become self-reliant. I had to learn to adapt to new surroundings and to fit in with different people, different cultures and different scenarios. 
												
												This has served me well in the service industry where we are dealing with a diverse array of people, cultures and personalities all the time.”<br>
												
												<br>His family ultimately settled in Cape Town, where he attended Fairmont High School. It was here where he started to develop his leadership skills, taking on various team and class roles, resulting in him becoming Deputy Head Boy as well as captain of the cricket and rugby first teams by the time he had reached matric. <br>
												
												<br>It was also at Fairmont that Greg first met Charl Jacobs, CEO of the Phangela Group - the start of a twenty year friendship between the two. Charl was Greg’s rugby coach from U14 to 1st XV level and they formed a special bond which cultivated an innate trust in one another. <br>
												
												<br>“In those days Fairmont was not a big rugby school. We were never expected to win or even compete, or to be anything worthwhile on the rugby field. We always had an underdog status. But Charl didn’t see this as a concern, but instead as an opportunity to do the unexpected, to win consistently.  And if I’m not mistaken, our rugby team still holds the record at Fairmont.”
												</p>

									<div class="tab-pane fade" id="nav-mission" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="nav-profile-tab">
										<div class="single-content">
											<h3>University</h3>
											<p>Greg says that this type of work ethic and mindset has similarly been cultivated in Phangela, where they are continually punching above their weight in an industry where peers and clients alike, were initially at least, vastly more experienced.<br>

												<br>After high school, he went on to The University of Stellenbosch to complete his B.Comm in Management Sciences.  He has also set his sights on completing his postgraduate diploma in Business Management and Administration at the University of Stellenbosch Business School.<br> 
												
												<br>“I think the biggest lesson I learnt at University was the independence factor.  There was nobody spoon feeding you information, or making sure you were at class at the required times, or even at all.  If you didn’t put the work in, you simply didn’t get the result.  It forced you to work on your own self-discipline, to be responsible.  And this has stood me good stead in later working years.”<br>
												
												<br>Having completed his B.Comm, he had initially taken up a role in the financial department of a law firm based in Bellville/Durbanville.  It was after two years that he felt he needed to spread his wings a bit, to go and experience some other parts of the world.  He then applied for a programme in Miami, USA, to become an art auctioneer on cruise ships.  On completion of the training course, and passing the final exams, he got his first cruise ship placement, where he would assist in managing an art gallery, and running large scale art auctions up to 4 times a week.  All done en route to some of the most beautiful ocean destinations in the world, from the Bahamas, to Bermuda, Puerto Rico and the Florida Keys.<br>
												
												<br>“Being an art auctioneer was an immense learning curve in how to deal with different people, from different backgrounds, cultures, countries and continents.  It put me outside of my comfort zone in that I had no support system, and had to create a friendship structure from scratch.  Means of communication wasn’t as easy as it is now, there was no WhatsApp, and being on the open water often meant no cell reception.  So you literally only had the people on your ship to experience all your highs and lows with.”<br>  
												
												<br>The art auctions took place in front of large crowds of people, over several hours and Greg says it was like putting on a show.<br>  
												
												<br>“A lot of things can go wrong during a live show and you have to be able to adapt, improvise, think on your feet and rise above the overwhelming pressure.  The show must go on!”<br>
												
												<br>He enjoys the challenges of being put under pressure and says his auctioneering days on the ship helped him hone his skills that he now uses in the security industry, which is extremely fast-paced and operates in a high-pressure environment.<br>

											<h3>Career</h3>
											<p>Greg started with Phangela in 2011 in a financial management role.<br> 
												<br>As the company has grown, his role has become more dynamic and his focus has expanded to include the strategic elements of the business such as implementing B-BBEE structures, Client Feasibility Analysis, Mergers & Acquisitions, Corporate Governance, Corporate Cash Flow Strategy and Corporate Strategic Alignment.<br>
												
												<br>“The day to day financial element is still a large part of my portfolio and remains close to my heart as it has an impact on everything within the organisation, its crucial that I keep abreast of these.  As the money is the lifeblood of any company.”<br>
												
												<br>He believes that great teamwork within the organisation makes his job easier as the operations team deliver a quality service and give the client an enjoyable experience. Because of this, he says the monetary discussion does not have become an emotional one, but merely the next step to service delivery in fair trade, based on facts and figures.<br>
												
												<br>Greg is inspired by the people who make up Phangela. <br>
												
												<br>“There is an incredible spirit within the walls of Phangela, and it is so tangible you can almost touch it.  We are the group of people who wont back down from any challenge, because we have an absolute trust in the person standing with us.  We continually push the envelope and challenge industry norms, and we all do it together.”<br>
												
												<br>He is unmarried, but believes that while being married to his work for the last eight years has been tumultuous, there have been more good times than bad!  Balance, however, is a crucial element for Greg, and this he does in several ways outside of work.  One of the main activities being music. He has been part of a music school for several years and sings, plays guitar and recently started learning to play the keyboard.   He has also been doing ballroom dancing for five years. And he firmly believes that the counter-balance of creative stimulation often brings an expanded perspective, clarity, intuition and insight to his working environment.<br>
												
												<br>Health and fitness is also a priority and he does boxing as well as Crossfit. He likes being in the outdoors and loves 4x4 camping trips with family and friends. <br>
												
												<br>He enjoys reading and loves travel and tries to visit a new country at least once a year.<br> 
												
												<br>Greg is immensely proud of the charity involvement and community upliftment aspect at Phangela.  Phangela runs its own internal upliftment program, Buried Life, every month, which is their own version of Make a Wish.<br>  
												
												
												<br>“Giving back is a massive priority for us. The Buried Life Initiative assists our own staff, giving back to those who work so hard for us.  The Buried Life allows employees who have been with us for a year or more to apply.  A successful application results in us assisting in some way that they may need.  Whether it be to pay for school fees, assist in rebuilding a home, buying necessary household appliances.  Things that most of us take for granted on a day to day basis.  But there are many out there who are fighting a daily struggle.  The winters in Cape Town are devastating and really take a toll on the living conditions of several of our staff.  Not only that, but everybody is fighting a battle that none of us are aware of.  We want people to come and work for Phangela, and we want to ensure that we reward that loyalty and hard work, by helping out where we can.”<br>
												
												<br>He is also involved, on behalf of Phangela, in various other projects, working alongside the likes of Radio Tygerberg and other major corporates on various initiatives that come up throughout the year. What he enjoys most about working on these uplifting initiatives is the ability to make a difference in people’s lives.<br> 
												
												<br>“Even though to you and I, it may be a small gesture.  But for someone else, that same gesture has the ability to change their lives.” he says.<br>
